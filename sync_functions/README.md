# Access the Forecast in Your Browser

Once your Flask application is running, you can access the following URLs in your web browser:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see the "Hello, World!" message.
http://127.0.0.1:5000/weather to see the weather forecast for Seattle.
The /weather endpoint will make a request to the National Weather Service API for the gridpoint corresponding to Seattle and return the forecast data.
